# Project Planning

- create a plan containing:
  1. `steps` required to accomplish the project objectives
  2. `tasks` to be performed at each step
    - using Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
  3. estimate of effort required for each task
  4. estimate of resources required for each task
  5. (with 3 & 4) calculate time to be taken for each task/step
  6. (with 3 & 4) calculate task, step and project costs
  7. Interdependencies of tasks
  8. schedule for each task & whole project
    - milestone, deliverables, payments, etc

> When we have to do plan the project, we normally do divide-and-conquer approach like scope => steps => tasks
> breaking down our project scope into a different steps according to our project objectives
> and then subdivide into a tasks

> 보통 프로젝트를 계획할때 top-down 접근법을 택하며 분할정복방법을 일반적으로 사용한다. 우리의 프로젝트 범위가 있으면 그것들을 단계로 나누고 그 단계들을 다시 업무로 다루는것이다.
> 단계들을 업무로 다시 분할 할 때는 (WBS) 방법을 주로 택하며 뒤에서 자세하게 살펴보도록 할것이다.



# Project Scope Management
`scope` means what do you really need to develop

- includes all works required for project (only required work)
- divide work into major pieces, then subdivide it into smaller & more manageable pieces

> What is important at this stage is to clearly determine to what extent we are really trying to develop and to what extent we are going to deal with.


# Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
> WBS can be represented as a tree or list in a table

this is a just vague example of WBS.
It shows the `steps` with subdivision of `tasks`.

### using WBS
The expected effects of using WBS are as follows. Understanding what WBS is like makes it natural to understand why these good effects are accompanied.

1. estimate & schedule work (durations, precedences)
2. organise & schedule resources
3. assign responsibilities (with 2)
4. estimate & allocate costs and budgets
5. add up costs to different levels (task, phase, contract...)
6. get resource commitments
7. schedule start & end dates ( duration ) 
8. track expenditures, schedules, performance

***
Here is the another example of WBS(Jira).
Jira is not just a issue tracker but can be used to agile(PM tool).

who's responsible?
Priority?
Duration ...

In that sense this WBS is a first thing we need to when we are planning the project.

### roles of WBS
- identify task
- calculate schedule, cost, resource
- schedule planning & allocation (work assignment)
- check progress of the entire schedule ( can be used with kanban )
- track / control project information
- link between customer & team (median stakeholder and team)


# Summary
- When planning a project, I knew what the first thing to do was and why I needed it.
- I learned what WBS is like and naturally understood the expected effects(pros).
- I think I should study while looking at examples of applying many WBSs.
